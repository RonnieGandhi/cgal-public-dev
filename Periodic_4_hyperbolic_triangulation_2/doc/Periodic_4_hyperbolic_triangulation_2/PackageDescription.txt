\cgalPkgDesc{This package allows to build and handle triangulations of point sets on the two dimensional
hyperbolic Bolza surface. Triangulations are built incrementally and can be modified by insertion or
removal of vertices. Point location facilities are also offered. The package provides Delaunay
triangulations and offers primitives to build the dual Voronoi diagrams.}

\cgalPkgDescriptionEnd
 
The main class of the 2D Periodic Triangulation package is `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`. 
This class allows to construct and modify Delaunay triangulations of the Bolza surface. A secondary 
class made available is `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2`, which gives access 
to the elements of the triangulation (vertices, edges, and faces), and functionality common to 
triangulations in general, such as point location. The class `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2` 
does <i>not</i> support insertion or removal of points. `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`
inherits `CGAL::Periodic_4_hyperbolic_triangulation_2`.

Both triangulation classes take a geometric traits and a triangulation data structure as template parameters. 
The geometric traits class must be a model of the concept `Periodic_4HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` 
to provide all predicates and constructions needed by the triangulation classes. The default triangulation data 
structure used is `CGAL::Triangulation_data_structure_2`. 

A triangulation is stored as a collection of vertices and faces that are linked together through incidence 
and adjacency relations. Each face gives access to its three incident vertices and to its three adjacent faces. 
Each vertex gives access to one of its incident faces. The three vertices of a face are indexed with 0, 1, and 
2 in positive (counter-clockwise) orientation. The orientation of faces on the Bolza surface is defined as 
the orientation of their canonical representatives in the underlying space, which is the hyperbolic plane 
\f$ \mathbb H^2\f$. 

To specify canonical representatives, which may contain vertices both inside and outside the original domain, 
we store additionally three hyperbolic translations, corresponding to each vertex. The hyperbolic translations 
are models of the concept `HyperbolicOctagonTranslation`.
