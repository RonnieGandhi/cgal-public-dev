This directory currently contains test programs and _not_ a real demo.
The file playground.cpp is used to execute various tests and verifications and changes constantly.
The file triangulation.cpp is a small driver to verify modifications on the hyperbolic (Delaunay) triangulation.
Over time the layout of the directory will change and a real demo will be build. For archiving purposes, the demo that previously existed here has been moved to the subfolder 'backup'.
