This package allows to compute Delaunay triangulations of point sets in the Poincar&eacute;
disk model of the hyperbolic plane, as well as their dual objects. 

\section HT2_Poincare_model The Poincar&eacute; Disk Model of the Hyperbolic Plane
The Poincar&eacute; disk model represents the hyperbolic plane
\f$\mathbb H^2\f$ as the open unit disk centered at the origin in the
Euclidean plane. The unit circle represents the set \f$\mathcal
H_\infty\f$ of points at infinity.

In this model, a hyperbolic line is either an arc of circle
perpendicular to the unit circle or, if it passes through the origin,
a diameter of the unit disk. A hyperbolic circle is a Euclidean circle
contained in the unit disk; however, its hyperbolic center and radius
are not the same as its Euclidean center and radius.

\section HT2_Euclidean_and_hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulations Euclidean and Hyperbolic Delaunay Triangulations
As hyperbolic circles coincide with Euclidean circles contained in the
unit disk, the combinatorial structure of the hyperbolic Delaunay
triangulation of a set \f$\mathcal P\f$ of points in \f$\mathbb H^2\f$
is a subset of the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of \f$\mathcal
P\f$. Of course, the hyperbolic and Euclidean geometric embeddings of a
given Delaunay face are different. See 
\cgalFigureRef{Hyperbolic_triangulation_2Euclidean_vs_hyperbolic}.

More precisely, the hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation of \f$\mathcal
P\f$ is a connected simplicial complex. It only
contains the simplices of the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation that
are <i>hyperbolic</i>:
<ul>
	<li> A Euclidean Delaunay face is hyperbolic if its
	circumscribing circle is contained in \f$\mathbb H^2\f$. 
	<li> An Euclidean Delaunay edge is hyperbolic if one fo the
	empty disks (i.e., not containing any point of \f$\mathcal
	P\f$) passing through its endpoints is contained in \f$\mathbb
	H^2\f$. 
</ul>
In the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation, there is a bijection between
non-hyperbolic faces and non-hyperbolic edges

The shaded face is non-hyperbolic. Its dashed edge is non-hyperbolic,
as no empty circle through its endpoints is contained in
\f$\mathbb H^2\f$. Its other two edges are hyperbolic.

\section HT2_Software_design Software Design
From what was said above, it is natural that the class
`Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2` privately inherits from the class
`Delaunay_triangulation_2`. So, users are encouraged to look at the chapter
\ref Chapter_2D_Triangulations "2D Triangulation" of the CGAL manual to 
know more in particular about the representation of triangulations in 
CGAL and the flexibility of the design. 

The class `Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2` has two template
parameters:
<ul>
	<li> A geometric traits class `Gt`, which provides geometric
	primitives. The requirements on this first template parameter
	are described by the concept
	`HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`, which refines
	`DelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`. 
	<li> A triangulation data structure parameter, for which the
	requirements are described by the concept
	`TriangulationDataStructure_2`. The default for this second template parameter
	is `Triangulation_data_structure_2< Triangulation_vertex_base_2<Gt>, Hyperbolic_triangulation_face_base_2<Gt> >`.
</ul>

Two models of the concept `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2`
are proposed for the geometric traits
class. The first one, `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_CK_traits_2`, is based
upon `CGAL::Circular_kernel_2` and guarantees exact constructions of
Delaunay triangulations and dual objects when the input points have
rational coordinates. The second one,
`CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2`, is more general,
as it guarantees exact constructions even for input points with
algebraic coordinates; however the first model is more efficient for
rational points. 

\section Examples
The example below shows insertion of random points in a hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation.
The same set of points is inserted twice. The first time points are inserted one by one, 
which causes Euclidean faces to be filtered at each insertion. The second time, all points 
are inserted and the filtering is done once at the end.
\cgalExample{Hyperbolic_triangulation_2/ht2_example.cpp}

The example below shows how user-defined info can be added to the hyperbolic faces.
