2D hyperbolic triangulations of \cgal are designed to represent triangulations of 
the hyperbolic plane. The vertices of the triangulation are defined by an input set of points.
The resulting triangulation is a connected <i>simplicial complex</i>,
i.e.:
<ul>
  <li> it contains all incident \f$ j\f$-simplices (\f$ j<k\f$) of any \f$ k\f$-simplex, and 
  <li> two \f$ k\f$-simplices either do not intersect or share a common \f$ j\f$-face, \f$ j<k\f$. 
</ul>
The resulting simplices of dimension 0, 1 and 2 are called <I>vertex</I>, <I>edge</I>, and
<I>face</I> respectively.
