\cgalPkgDesc{This package allows to build and handle Delaunay triangulations of point sets 
in the hyperbolic plane. Triangulations are built incrementally and can be modified by insertion
and removal of vertices; point location facilities are also offered, as well as primitives to 
build the dual Voronoi diagrams.}

\cgalPkgDescriptionEnd
 
The Delaunay triangulation of a set of points \f$P\f$ in the hyperbolic plane \f$\mathbb H^2\f$ is a two-dimensional connected simplicial complex with vertex set defined by the points \f$P\f$. In fact, the hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation of \f$P\f$ is a subset of the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of \f$P\f$. This package offers the necessary functionality to obtain the hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation of \f$P\f$ from the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation of \f$P\f$.

## Concepts ##
The main concept `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` provides an interface for geometric objects, constructions, and predicates in the hyperbolic plane. The concept `HyperbolicTriangulationFaceBase_2` provides an interface that allows faces of the hyperbolic Delaunay triangulation to be filtered from the faces of the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation.

- `HyperbolicTriangulationFaceBase_2`

## Classes ##


The main class of the 2D Hyperbolic Triangulation package, which allows the constructions of Delaunay triangulations in the hyperbolic plane, is `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`. It offers all the functionalities provided by `CGAL::Delaunay_triangulation_2`, such as point location, insertion and removal. Construction of the dual Voronoi diagram is also provided. 

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_2`


Two models for the concept `HyperbolicDelaunayTriangulationTraits_2` are provided. The traits class `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_CK_traits_2` is based upon `CGAL::Circular_kernel_2` and guarantees exact computations when the input points have rational coordinates. The traits class `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2` is by default based upon `CGAL::Cartesian<CORE::Expr>` and guarantees exact computations for input points with rational coordinates. `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_traits_2` is used as base for the traits class in the package \ref PkgPeriodic4HyperbolicTriangulation2Summary.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_Delaunay_triangulation_CK_traits_2`

Finally, a model for the concept `HyperbolicTriangulationFaceBase_2` is also provided.

- `CGAL::Hyperbolic_triangulation_face_base_2`
