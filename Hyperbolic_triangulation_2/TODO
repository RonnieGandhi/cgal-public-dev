==== new ====

add Hyperbolic_triangulation_face_base_wth_info_2

add operator == for triangulations

** clean approximations

the construction of the (hyperbolic) segment should not be approximated in the traits
the approximation should be done for the demo only

similar: clean find_intersection
(using the circular kernel will do)

fix construct_circumcenter. no approx allowed
(again, CK will do)

CK, or at least Cartesian with sqrt (?)

** doc

** tests

** only keep relevant files for the submission

========== demo



--- create an adapted Graphicsitem that does not require finite_* stuff. Replace by hyperbolic_*
       => understand apply_to_range
the graphicsitem should also not require Segment_2 or Line_segment_2 (does it?)

--- fix bugs:
- conflict regions (when inserting or in mode 'show conflict zone)
show Euclidean triangles instead of hyperbolic triangles  
- in mode 'draw circumcenter', some triangles that are not in the
hyperbolic DT appear, with their circle intersecting the infinite
line. They should not appear.

Done
 
- However, we could think to add a specific mode allowing to show
triangles that are not hyperbolic. Not sure whether this is interesting. 
- cosmetic detail: the title of the demo should mention "hyperbolic"

--- PainterOstream
Is it clean for CGAL to have a local file?

I have to ask Laurent to make some members of PainterOstream protected.
It allows me to have a local file with partial specialization of 
the class PainterOstream.
I have to discuss with Laurent.

========== OLD STUFF code

--- sqrt
check whether and when an exact type is needed for sqrt. 
- sqrt can be kept eg for demos
- when needed, replace the inexact CGAL::sqrt by the new type
replacing CGAL::Root_of_2, see 
CGAL::https://cgal.geometryfactory.com/CGAL/Members/wiki/Features/Unique_sqrt_extension 

Done. std::sqrt is replaced by CGAL::sqrt everywhere, 
because it's used only for computation of the Voronoi diagram. 

--- use the Circular_kernel?
because Do_intersect is in the Circular_kernel

Done. CGAL::do_intersect is a solution. 
No need for the Circular_kernel.
--> (MT) wrong for constrcutions. Approximations are used in several places. 

========== future

--- make Constrained_delaunay_... work with Hyperbolic_triangulation_2
--- make Mesh_2 work with Hyperbolic_triangulation_2
O.Faugeras and his student are waiting for it.
